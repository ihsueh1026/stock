# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Run / develop

```bash
# install (one-time)
pip3 install --user fastapi uvicorn requests openpyxl
# optional: enables LLM sentiment/summary on MOPS news (news_llm.py)
pip3 install --user anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...

# web app — run from repo root, NOT from stock_web/
python3 -m uvicorn stock_web.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000

# CLI fetcher (writes stock.xlsx with one sheet per stock)
python3 fetch_twse_daily.py                  # default: 2324, 30 days
python3 fetch_twse_daily.py -s 2330 2317 -n 60
python3 fetch_twse_daily.py --no-taiex
```

There are no tests, no linter config, and no build step. Verification is manual: run the server, hit endpoints, and watch logs.

## Architecture

The repo is a Taiwan-stock (TWSE 上市 + TPEX 上櫃) technical-analysis tool with two layers that share fetcher/indicator logic:

- **[fetch_twse_daily.py](fetch_twse_daily.py)** — standalone CLI. Pulls daily OHLCV from TWSE `STOCK_DAY` / TPEX `tradingStock`, plus TAIEX from `FMTQIK`, computes MA/RSI/KD/MACD/%change, and writes `stock.xlsx` (one sheet per stock). Uses a 250-day warmup buffer so the 26-day EMA inside MACD converges close to broker-app values. Throttles requests with `REQUEST_INTERVAL_SEC = 3` and retries transient TWSE "查詢日期大於今日" errors with backoff.

- **[stock_web/app.py](stock_web/app.py)** — FastAPI backend. Imports `fetch_twse_daily` as `twse` (note `sys.path` insertion at the top) and reuses its fetchers + `sma/rsi_wilder/kd/macd/pct_change/parse_*`. Adds an ADX(14) Wilder implementation locally. Serves [stock_web/static/index.html](stock_web/static/index.html) (single-file SPA, ~1700 lines) at `/`.

- **[stock_web/static/index.html](stock_web/static/index.html)** — entire frontend in one file (HTML + CSS + JS). Dark theme, mobile-aware, no build tooling.

- **Sibling fetchers in [stock_web/](stock_web/)** — each module is a single-responsibility fetcher with its own daily-cached JSON output and a matching `/api/...` endpoint:
  - [news_fetcher.py](stock_web/news_fetcher.py) — MOPS 重大訊息 (t05st01). Parses Big5 HTML, throttles at 2 s/request.
  - [news_llm.py](stock_web/news_llm.py) — optional: calls Anthropic API (Haiku 4.5) to tag each 重訊 as 利多/利空/中性 + summary. **Fails soft**: missing `anthropic` SDK or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → items pass through unchanged. Idempotent — items already carrying `sentiment` + `summary` are skipped, so re-runs against partially-annotated cache are free. System prompt is `cache_control:ephemeral` for the 5-min prompt-cache window.
  - [fundamentals_fetcher.py](stock_web/fundamentals_fetcher.py) — MOPS t146sb05 簡明 statements (3-4 most recent periods). Server-side derives margin % and pre-tax ROE proxy so the SPA doesn't redo arithmetic. Amounts arrive in 千元.
  - [eps_history_fetcher.py](stock_web/eps_history_fetcher.py) — multi-year quarterly EPS via MOPS ajax_t164sb04. **Q4 quirk**: t164sb04 returns standalone EPS for Q1-Q3 but **cumulative full-year** EPS for Q4 (because the Q4 filing is the annual report). The fetcher derives Q4 = annual − (Q1+Q2+Q3) explicitly.
  - [dividend_fetcher.py](stock_web/dividend_fetcher.py) — TWSE/TPEX OpenAPI (BWIBBU_ALL / tpex_mainboard_peratio_analysis) for yield + per-share cash dividend. TWSE only exposes yield; TPEX exposes both.
  - [industry_pe_fetcher.py](stock_web/industry_pe_fetcher.py) — joins the same OpenAPI PER feeds with the daily company-info dump to compute median/quartile P/E per industry. Negative-or-zero PERs are excluded.
  - [revenue_fetcher.py](stock_web/revenue_fetcher.py) — monthly 月營收 from `t21sc03_{ROC_Y}_{M}_0.html`. Cached per (market, year, month) under names like `revenue_sii_202604.json` — these files are **immutable once published** and intentionally sit outside the dated-cache purge window (the filename has no YYYYMMDD suffix, so `_parse_cache_date` returns None and the purger skips them).

- **[backtest/](backtest/)** — event-study pipeline. [study.py](backtest/study.py) walks the full history of a single stock, recomputes the 7 lights at every bar (no look-ahead), and measures forward returns / alpha at 5/10/20/40 trading days for each summary-label transition. [build_stats.py](backtest/build_stats.py) pools those results across every stock under `backtest/data/*.json` into `backtest/data/_summary_stats.json`, which the live dashboard reads via `/api/backtest_stats` to display historical hit rates next to the current summary label. [prefetch.py](backtest/prefetch.py) / [prefetch_t86.py](backtest/prefetch_t86.py) seed the long-horizon caches study.py needs.

### Trading-day key

`_trading_day()` in [stock_web/app.py](stock_web/app.py) returns today's calendar date, walking back over weekends to the prior Friday. All daily caches (`{code}_{YYYYMMDD}.json`, `taiex_{YYYYMMDD}.json`, `t86_{YYYYMMDD}.json`, `companies_{YYYYMMDD}.json`) share this same tag. If today's TAIEX close hasn't been published yet (e.g. fetched intraday or right after 13:30 close), `taiex` rows come back null and the frontend's `taiexBar` ([stock_web/static/index.html](stock_web/static/index.html)) prompts the user to enter the close manually — which `PUT /api/taiex/today` persists and back-patches into existing per-stock caches.

### Cache layer ([stock_web/cache/](stock_web/cache/))

All caches are flat JSON files in `stock_web/cache/`, keyed by date in the filename:

- `{code}_{YYYYMMDD}.json` — per-stock parsed series + computed indicators. Stored as `{"code", "market", "rows": [...]}`. Old caches without `adx` are backfilled in-memory on load via `_backfill_adx`.
- `taiex_{YYYYMMDD}.json` — TAIEX close history (date-iso → close).
- `taiex_manual.json` — user-entered TAIEX overrides per date (PUT/DELETE `/api/taiex/today`). Overlay applies on top of auto cache. **Persistent — never purged** (no date suffix).
- `t86_{YYYYMMDD}.json` / `t86otc_{YYYYMMDD}.json` — three-major-investor net-shares per stock for that date. **Empty OR truncated results are NEVER persisted** (see `_fetch_t86` + `_t86_looks_complete`). TWSE occasionally serves a partial dump that's missing 200-300 listings but still includes warrants/ETFs, so a raw entry count isn't enough — we count 4-digit codes and require ≥ `T86_TWSE_MIN_STOCKS` / `T86_OTC_MIN_STOCKS`. Incomplete dumps would otherwise pin step 7 (法人) to gray for affected stocks indefinitely.
- `companies[_otc]_{YYYYMMDD}.json` — daily TWSE/TPEX company-info dump (~1MB). One fetch per trading day.

**Retention**: dated cache files older than `CACHE_RETENTION_DAYS` (7) are deleted on startup by `_purge_old_caches()`, called from the FastAPI startup event in a background thread. The 7-day floor is load-bearing — `_load_stock` looks back through the same window to find a prior cache for incremental refresh (see below). Don't drop below 7 without auditing both.

**Incremental per-stock refresh**: when today's cache is missing, `_load_stock` calls `_find_recent_stock_cache(code)` to grab the freshest cache within the last 7 days, then fetches only the current month (plus the prior month if `last_date` is in a different calendar month) via `month_fetcher`. Indicators are recomputed from the full merged series (recomputation is cheap; indicator state isn't persisted). Falls back to the original 13-month walk only when no prior cache exists. This drops a typical refresh from ~30–40s to a few seconds.

Concurrency: per-key locks via `_lock_for(key)` (with a guard mutex for the lock dict). Used for stock fetches, T86 fetches per market+date, TAIEX, and company info — prevents thundering-herd duplicate fetches when multiple watchlist items refresh at once.

### Markets (TWSE vs OTC) routing

`MARKET_TWSE = "twse"` (上市) and `MARKET_OTC = "otc"` (上櫃) are passed through every fetcher. A code's market is resolved via `_market_for(code)` against the daily company-info caches; falls back to TWSE for unknown codes (e.g. brand-new listings). The market is persisted into the per-stock cache JSON so subsequent loads don't have to re-resolve.

### 7-step dashboard

**Positioning**: this is a **market-state dashboard, not an entry/exit signal generator**. Backtest in [backtest/](backtest/) on 2395/5388/2357 over 5 years showed no signal predicts forward alpha across stocks/horizons. Summary labels (`🟢 多頭擴張` / `多頭發展` / `🔵 反彈訊號` / `🔴 趨勢轉弱` / `🟠 訊號分歧` / `🟡 盤整中`) describe *current state* — they do not say "buy now" or "sell now". The label strings live in `SUMMARY_LABELS` in [stock_web/app.py](stock_web/app.py) and are re-imported by `backtest/study.py` (`SIGNAL_DEFS`) and `backtest/exit_rules.py` (`BAD_SUMMARIES`), so a label rename propagates without manual sync.

`compute_dashboard()` runs seven traffic-light checks over the last 20 trading days: `_step_1_market`, `_step_2_trend`, `_step_3_momentum`, `_step_4_volume`, `_step_6_holding`, `_step_7_exit`, `_step_8_institutional`. (Steps are numbered for the UI 1..7 after assembly — original numbering 1/2/3/4/6/7/8 reflects an earlier draft that included a 停損 step now surfaced separately via `_stoploss_levels`.) Each step returns `{light: green|yellow|red|gray, detail, ...}`. `_summary()` collapses them into a single overall light/label, `_price_zones()` emits buy/sell ranges based on σ (std-dev of last 19 daily changes), and `_history_lights()` recomputes the lights for each of the last 15 days. Before the history loop, `_history_lights` prefetches T86 for the 19 dates that step 8 will need (the 15-day window plus the 4-day lookback) so every history row's institutional light is populated, not just where cache happened to exist. T86 is whole-market data shared across stocks, so a cold sync pays this cost once per day across the watchlist.

The trigger logic and cell ranges in `_step_*` functions mirror the formulas in `stock.xlsx` (see comments referencing B6:B25, N32, etc.) — when changing thresholds, keep that mental cross-reference in mind.

**Divergence + alerts (layered on top of the 7 lights, not gates)**: `_divergence()` compares the last 5 bars to the prior 10 looking for price/RSI6 disagreement; a bearish (頂背離) result soft-downgrades step 3 green→yellow, and either direction surfaces as an alert chip. `_compute_alerts()` emits chips for 爆量 / 量縮 / 法人連 N 日同向 / 背離 — these annotate the current view only and don't recompute over the history strip. Alerts respect `cached_only` so they can be evaluated without fanning out T86 fetches.

**Chip sub-shape annotations**: some chips carry small sub-labels alongside the main text — `streak` badge (consecutive-day count, with 🚀 高確信 for known sweet-spots), `industry_note` (per-industry chip-failure / amplification warnings, see `INDUSTRY_CHIP_NOTES` in `_compute_alerts`), and `shape_note` (for `reversal_inst_confirm_4` only: identifies WHICH of the 5 reversal-quality conditions is missing, since 4★ means exactly one is). Sub-shapes worth annotating per [backtest/reversal_4star_missing_study.py](backtest/reversal_4star_missing_study.py) on the 50-stock universe (n=302 qualifying events, baseline +2.99% / 59% at 40d): **missing C1** (近20日低) → 起跑型, 40d +7.74% / 71% (n=34) — green/good tone; **missing C2** (前期跌幅 ≥7.5%) → 假反轉型, 40d −5.21% / 14% (n=7, rare but consistent across horizons) — red/warn tone. C3/C4/C5 missing slots are near baseline and intentionally NOT annotated to avoid label-noise. CSS class `.al-shape` mirrors `.al-ind` visually with its own colour palette.

### API surface (all under `/api/`)

- `GET /api/stock/{code}?rows=N` — full series + dashboard (rows clamped 1..500).
- `GET|POST /api/watchlist`, `PUT|DELETE /api/watchlist/{code}`, `POST /api/watchlist/{code}/refresh`, `POST /api/watchlist/refresh` (batch — refresh every code), `POST /api/watchlist/reorder` — watchlist persisted to [stock_web/watchlist.json](stock_web/watchlist.json).
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /api/taiex/today` — manual TAIEX override. PUT also patches every existing per-stock cache for today whose last row's `taiex` is null (so dashboards reflect the override without a full refetch).
- `GET /api/news/{code}?days=14` — MOPS 重訊 with optional LLM annotations. The frontend renders a "copy news for Claude" button when `news_llm.is_available()` returns false, so users without an API key can still get sentiment by pasting into a chat.
- `GET /api/fundamentals/{code}?close=...` — annual EPS/margins/equity panel. `close` is optional and only used to derive a trailing P/E.
- `GET /api/eps_history/{code}?years=3` — multi-year quarterly EPS trend (with the Q4 fix-up). Response also includes an `eps_state` block: current YoY pattern (`accel`/`decel`/`neutral`, where accel = strictly increasing YoY over 3 quarters AND |EPS|≥0.5) plus this code's historical forward alpha at 20/60/120d for both accel and decel events (from `backtest/data/_eps_state_stats.json`, built by `python3 -m backtest.build_eps_state_stats`). UI renders this as a small badge + muted history line inside the 季 EPS 趨勢 panel — **observation only, not actionable**: the pool-level study (`backtest/eps_acceleration_study.py`, n=47 codes × 5y) shows accel vs decel 60d spread +4.5pp but per-stock breadth splits ~48% / 52%, so per-stock track record matters more than the pool stat.
- `GET /api/dividend/{code}?close=...`, `GET /api/industry_pe/{code}?per=...` — yield + per-industry P/E context.
- `GET /api/revenue/{code}` — monthly revenue series (immutable monthly cache).
- `GET /api/backtest_stats?label=...` — historical forward-return distribution for the current summary label, served from `backtest/data/_summary_stats.json`. **Stale unless [backtest/build_stats.py](backtest/build_stats.py) is re-run** after collecting fresh per-stock studies.
- `GET /api/institutional/{code}?days=20` — per-stock 三大法人 deeper view: for each of 外資 / 投信 / 自營, the consecutive buy/sell streak + N-day cumulative net (張) + a daily series for the UI bar strip. Reads T86 per day with **production cache → permanent backtest store (`backtest/data/t86[otc]/`) fallback** so a 20-day window resolves without any network fetch (the recent-day gap is kept warm by the dashboard's `_history_lights` T86 prefetch). `days` clamps to [5, 60]. Surfaced as the 法人動向 card on the detail page — deeper than the step-8 法人 light, observation-only. Net values are shares → 張 (÷1000).
- `GET /api/margin_sbl/{code}?days=10` — per-stock 融資 (margin) / 融券 (margin short) / 借券 (SBL) daily snapshot + trailing N-day history. Sources: TWSE `exchangeReport/MI_MARGN tables[1]` for 融資+融券 (in 張/lots), TWSE `rwd/zh/marginTrading/TWT93U` 借券 cols 8-13 (in 股/shares, converted to lots). Whole-market dumps cached per trading day at `stock_web/cache/margin_{YYYYMMDD}.json` + `sbl_{YYYYMMDD}.json`. `get_for_code()` opportunistically fetches the most-recent day on first hit but never fans out historical days. **TWSE only — OTC returns `available:false` with `reason`** (not yet implemented). The morning `watchlist-refresh` launchd job calls `fetch_margin` + `fetch_sbl` daily so by 9am the dumps are warm; UI hides the panel cleanly when not available. Response also includes an **`s4_state` block** when 借券 5日變化 ≤ -15% (S4 signal — observation tag inspired by [backtest/s4_sbl_covering_sweep.py](backtest/s4_sbl_covering_sweep.py): pool 40d alpha +0.08% / 50% win / +2.35pp vs baseline, 61% per-stock breadth on 48 codes — marginal, NOT chip-worthy, hence surfaced as an info-tone badge with per-stock history (`backtest/data/_s4_state_stats.json`, built by `python3 -m backtest.build_s4_state_stats`) so the user can check if THIS code historically delivered. Sweep also found S4 weakens 4★+綠 reversal chip when co-fired (-5.01pp Δ at 40d) — see [backtest/s4_chip_combo_study.py](backtest/s4_chip_combo_study.py) — so we explicitly DON'T chain it to chip emission.
- `GET /api/us_market` — latest 1-day close + change% for ^DJI / ^IXIC / ^SOX / NVDA / TSM / AAPL / GOOGL. Reads `backtest/data/_us_{TICKER}.json` files written by `python3 -m backtest.prefetch_us` (yfinance-based, ~30s for 7 tickers). The morning launchd `watchlist-refresh` job (see below) refreshes these as a side effect, so usually fresh; UI also tags the `us-bar` with `.stale` when as_of is older than 4 calendar days as a fallback.

`/api/watchlist/{code}/refresh` and `/api/watchlist/refresh` are both synchronous. With incremental refresh and warm shared caches (TAIEX/T86/companies), single-stock refresh is a few seconds and a 30-stock batch is typically under a minute. Cold first-ever fetch with no prior cache still hits the 13-month walk (~30–60s per stock).

## Notes for editing

- Do NOT lower `REQUEST_INTERVAL_SEC` below 3 — TWSE rate-limits aggressively and starts returning bogus "查詢日期大於今日" errors.
- When changing cache JSON shape, account for the in-memory backfill path (`_backfill_adx`) so day-old caches still load.
- When adding step logic that needs T86 data, respect `cached_only` — historical-strip recomputes must not fan out network calls.
- Stock codes are validated as 4–6 digits in `_validate_code`; the file-prefix check in `taiex_today_put` (`prefix.isdigit() and 4 <= len(prefix) <= 6`) keeps non-stock caches (`taiex_`, `t86_`, `companies_`) from being patched.
- The web layer's `WEB_WARMUP_DAYS = 60` is shorter than the CLI's `WARMUP_DAYS = 250`; this trades a tiny MACD-EMA precision loss for response time. Don't unify them without understanding the trade-off.
- Summary labels are defined once in `stock_web/app.py` (`SUMMARY_LABELS`) and consumed by `backtest/study.py` (`SIGNAL_DEFS`) and `backtest/exit_rules.py` (`BAD_SUMMARIES`). Renaming a key (e.g. `"strong"`) is a real refactor — find/replace it everywhere. Renaming a label *value* (the emoji/string) is safe but invalidates pooled stats in `backtest/data/_summary_stats.json` keyed by the old string, so re-run [backtest/build_stats.py](backtest/build_stats.py) after.
- `news_llm.py` must keep failing soft. The MOPS news panel is the only feature that touches a paid API; never make it a hard dependency or fan it out into batch refresh paths.
- Monthly revenue files (`revenue_*_{YYYYMM}.json`) must keep their non-YYYYMMDD filename so `_purge_old_caches()` skips them. Don't rename to a date-suffixed scheme without teaching the purger.

## Manual-via-Claude workflows

Two log files live at `stock_web/*.jsonl` (both gitignored as per-user runtime data). They accumulate over time and are deliberately not automated, so the user controls when data refreshes.

### `stock_web/forward_log.jsonl` — chip OOS validation
Captured automatically by `watchlist_chips()` whenever the watchlist is scanned. No user action needed — runs daily as part of the chip-scan flow. Filled by lazy + cron sweep (see `stock_web/forward_log.py`).

### `stock_web/news_log.jsonl` — Yahoo Finance news + sentiment
Captured manually through a Claude conversation. The user types **「更新 watchlist 新聞」** (or similar) and the assistant:

1. Reads `stock_web/watchlist.json` → list of codes
2. Reads existing `stock_web/news_log.jsonl` → builds set of `(code, news_date, title)` tuples already logged (dedup)
3. WebFetches `https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/quote/{code}.TW/news` for each code (or `.TWO` for OTC codes 5xxx/6xxx — verify by checking the stock's market in `_market_for(code)`)
4. For each article in the response: skip if already in dedup set; otherwise classify sentiment (利多/利空/中性), classify type (媒體報導/公司公告), extract analyst mentions (target prices, rating changes, foreign institutional buy/sell), generate 1-line summary
5. Append new records to the JSONL (one line per record)
6. Report to user: how many new records added, sentiment distribution shift

Record schema:
```json
{
  "fetched_at": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "news_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" or "no-date",
  "code": "1234",
  "source": "鉅亨網" | "中央社財經" | etc,
  "title": "...",
  "type": "媒體報導" | "公司公告",
  "sentiment": "利多" | "利空" | "中性",
  "summary": "1-line Chinese summary",
  "analyst_mentions": [{"firm": "...", "target": 495, "action": "上修"}]
}
```

Cadence: weekly or biweekly (user-paced). No automation. The intent is to build a multi-month dataset that, joined with `forward_log.jsonl` and historical chip events, will eventually answer "does chip × sentiment combo carry independent edge?"

When the user asks for **chip × sentiment analysis**, write an ad-hoc script that reads both JSONLs, joins on (code, date), buckets by sentiment, and reports forward alpha per chip × sentiment cell. Don't ship UI for it until the sample is large enough (3+ months of accumulation).

### Trigger phrase memo

| User says | Action |
|---|---|
| 「更新 watchlist 新聞」 | **Two-step refresh: Yahoo + MOPS.** Smart-skip first for each side independently. (1) Yahoo: read `stock_web/news_log.jsonl`, find max `fetched_at`. If it equals today's date, skip; otherwise WebFetch each watchlist code's Yahoo news page → dedup → classify + extract → append. (2) MOPS: for each watchlist code, load `stock_web/cache/news_{code}_*.json` (latest). Find items with empty `sentiment` or `summary` (the LLM-availability-gated fields in `news_fetcher` schema). Classify each based on title text and write back into the cache JSON in-place. This makes the merged 消息面 panel show sentiment chips for MOPS items too (without needing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY). Report new Yahoo records + new MOPS annotations + sentiment distribution delta. |
| 「更新 {code} 新聞」 (single code) | Same two-step refresh but per-code: smart-skip Yahoo for that code, annotate unannotated MOPS items in that code's latest cache. Verify code is in watchlist before fetching to avoid scope creep. |
| 「強制更新 watchlist 新聞」 | Bypass smart-skip and run the full flow regardless. Use sparingly — typically only needed when you suspect the morning fetch missed something or want to confirm latest. |
| 「看 news_log 統計」 | Read `stock_web/news_log.jsonl` and report total records, per-code count, sentiment distribution, source distribution, analyst-mention count, last fetched_at. No fetching, just read+aggregate. |
| 「跑 chip × sentiment 分析」 | Read `stock_web/news_log.jsonl` + `stock_web/forward_log.jsonl`, join on (code, date ± window), bucket by sentiment, report per-chip × per-sentiment forward alpha cells. If sample is thin (<3 months accumulation, <50 events per cell), report "early — wait for more data" rather than overselling weak signal. |

**Smart-skip rationale** (recorded so future sessions don't over-fetch):
For chip × sentiment join the relevant timestamp is `news_date` (when the news was published), NOT `fetched_at`. Yahoo Finance keeps ~14 days of news visible, so a weekly fetch captures the same news set as daily fetches. Daily fetching adds operational risk (Yahoo WAF, ritual fatigue, WebFetch quota) with zero analytical benefit. The smart-skip means the user can safely set a daily reminder to say "更新 watchlist 新聞" without burning quota — the workflow becomes idempotent within a trading day.

**Automation**: a `launchd` job (weekday 21:00) is set up via `tools/launchd/install.sh`. It runs `claude -p "更新 watchlist 新聞"` in this repo so the trigger phrase + smart-skip flow above does the actual work. See `tools/launchd/README.md` for install/verify/uninstall. The log lives at `tools/launchd/news-update.log` (gitignored).

**Morning pre-fetch automation** (separate launchd job, weekdays 07:00): `tools/launchd/install_watchlist_refresh.sh` installs `com.user.claude-watchlist-refresh`, which runs `python3 -m tools.refresh_watchlist`. That script mirrors `/api/watchlist/refresh` (drop per-stock cache + re-fetch via the shared TWSE/T86/companies pipeline) and additionally calls `backtest.prefetch_us.fetch_ticker` for the 7 US tickers. No `claude` CLI involved → no token cost. By 09:00 TWSE open the watchlist loads instantly; US strip is also fresh. Log at `tools/launchd/watchlist-refresh.log` (gitignored).

The detail-page "消息面" card MERGES both sources into a single timeline (see `loadNews`/`renderNewsMerged` in index.html). Each row has a source-letter badge (`M` MOPS / `Y` Yahoo) plus the sentiment chip. Sort is date desc; ties break MOPS-first. Meta line shows per-source counts and Yahoo freshness so the user can see at a glance whether they should run "更新 watchlist 新聞". The two underlying endpoints (`/api/news/{code}` and `/api/news_log/{code}`) stay separate so chip × sentiment analysis can still source them independently.
